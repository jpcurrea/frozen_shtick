# The Frozen Sick: A Chronicle

## The Journey Thus Far

---

In the bitter cold of the world's edge, where ice stretches to meet an iron sky and the wind carries whispers of forgotten things, three unlikely souls found themselves bound by fate and circumstance. Palebank Village—that small, suspicious outpost of hardy fisher-folk—had become a refuge for each of them, though for vastly different reasons. Arakki, the tiefling with eyes that caught firelight in strange ways, had arrived only recently, seeking anonymity in the frozen wastes. Jwala, the bronze dragonborn whose cut wings spoke of ideals and sacrifice, had made the village her home for months, drawn by purposes known only to herself. And Serelion, the keen-eyed elf whose quiet observation missed nothing, had likewise chosen this remote place as his dwelling.

It was death that brought them together.

Urgon Wenth, a villager of no particular consequence, had perished in a manner most unnatural. Over the course of weeks, his veins had turned the color of winter ice, his movements slowing until at last he stood frozen—a statue of flesh transformed to crystal and cold. At his funeral, Chief Elro Aldataur spoke not of mourning alone, but of fear. The affliction—nameless and terrible—had come from somewhere, and it would come again unless its source was found and ended.

One hundred gold pieces bought the services of these three strangers. A generous sum for a poor village, and a desperate one.

The investigation led them first to Urgon's modest home, where under the watchful eye of Mila the guard, they pieced together fragments of a darker puzzle. The dead man had traveled to Eiselcross, that distant realm of endless winter, and returned with curious treasures—among them, two blue vials of unknown origin and purpose.

But the vials were gone, stolen months past by Tulgi Latan when she robbed Pelc's Curiosities. She too had succumbed to the same creeping cold after her theft, and the trail of sickness and larceny led through blood and violence. At the curiosity shop, the three heroes found not answers but enemies—elf bandits who thought to finish what Tulgi had begun. The battle was swift and brutal, fire and blade doing their ancient work. When the last bandit broke beneath interrogation, a name spilled forth: Hulil Latan, sister to the thief, hiding in Croaker Cave with her band of outlaws.

The cave system proved stranger still than expected. Giant frogs lurked in dark waters, teeth and tongues eager for unwary flesh. The bandits, when finally encountered, showed no hostility—instead, they guided the heroes deeper, past a makeshift camp where ten bedrolls lay arranged and a hidden trap waited beneath. In the deepest chamber, they found Hulil Latan herself, attended by a lone assistant. The bandit leader lay upon a crude bed, her veins threading blue beneath pale skin, the same creeping cold that had claimed Urgon spreading through her flesh. It was she who shared the affliction's name: Frigid Woe. She touched the stolen vials and the touch doomed her. Beside her bed sat a curious chest, its surface carved with the visage of a dragon—locked, mysterious, speaking of secrets yet unrevealed.

A cure must be found. And the only path to answers led north, to the frozen wastes of Eiselcross itself—to the place where the blue vials had first been discovered, where the source of this creeping death waited in the ice.

Three heroes, bound by gold and circumstance. Three souls, each carrying secrets and purpose. One journey into the frozen dark, where the true adventure would begin.

The road to Eiselcross beckoned, cold and merciless as fate itself.
